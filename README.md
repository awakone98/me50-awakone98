# Basic's of Intellectual Property Law

**Environment:** Python, Flask, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS

## About 
For my CS50 Final Project, I wanted to build something that could be  useful for myself & others who have an interest in law, or are currently facing legal troubles. I decided to use my background in government and interest in coding to develope a simple, web application that disscuss Intellectual Property Law which interestingly enough combines Law and technology. 
To run it: `python app.py`

### Usage
`<nav`
The navigation button lets us browse the web application for relevant information. This aims to be useful when needing to access information easily and quickly through the open and close tabs, move up and down the page, and returning to a previous page.
 
`<form`
This allows users to interact with the web application by inputting information about themselves to recieve more information. 

### Resources
This software relies on the HarvardX CS50 and w3schools for a lot of the functionality.
